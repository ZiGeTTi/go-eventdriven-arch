# Go Order EDA

This project is an event-driven application for order processing, built with Go. It uses MongoDB for data storage and RabbitMQ for messaging between services.

## ðŸ§  Application Logic Flow

The application follows an event-driven pattern. Here is the sequential logic for a typical order creation process:

1.  **Create Order**: A user sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/orders/create-order`.
2.  **Order Requested**: The `OrderService` creates an `OrderRequestedEvent` and publishes it to the `order_events` exchange in RabbitMQ.
3.  **Inventory Check**: The `InventoryService` consumes the `OrderRequestedEvent`, checks for product availability, and reserves the requested quantity.
4.  **Inventory Status Update**: Based on the stock check, the `InventoryService` publishes an `InventoryStatusUpdatedEvent` indicating whether the product is available.
5.  **Notification**: The `NotificationService` consumes the `InventoryStatusUpdatedEvent` and sends a confirmation or cancellation notification to the user.
6.  **Order Status Update**: The `OrderService` also listens for the `InventoryStatusUpdatedEvent` to update the order status to `Confirmed` or `Cancelled`.
